          I've been programming since I was 8 years old, and I've been helping
          businesses build software professionally for the past 11 years.  My focus
          is on building working software, the right way.

            Mobile Discovery was an early endeavor to link physical ads with the

            as an ad campaign management and anaylitics platform, and consumers
            as a way to manage privacy and more easily connect to interesting
            content.
